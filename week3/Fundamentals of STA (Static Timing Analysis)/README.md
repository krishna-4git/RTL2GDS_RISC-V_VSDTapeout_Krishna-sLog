# üß† Fundamentals of Static Timing Analysis (STA)

## üìò Overview
**Static Timing Analysis (STA)** is a crucial step in digital circuit verification that ensures a design meets its **timing requirements** ‚Äî without needing simulation vectors.  
It checks whether all **data paths** meet **setup and hold time constraints**, ensuring reliable operation across all **process, voltage, and temperature (PVT)** corners.

## 1. Timing Path
A **timing path** is the logical route a signal takes from a start point to an endpoint.

- **Start Points:** Flip-flop clock pins or input ports  
- **End Points:** Flip-flop data (D) pins or output ports  

üßÆ **Example Path Types**
- Register to Register (reg2reg)  
- Input to Register (in2reg)  
- Register to Output (reg2out)  
- Input to Output (in2out)

---

## 2. Arrival Time and Slack
- **Actual Arrival Time (AAT):** Time when a signal actually reaches its endpoint.  
- **Required Arrival Time (RAT):** Latest time by which the signal *must* arrive for proper operation.

üìè **Slack Formula**

 **Slack = RAT ‚Äì AAT

 - **Positive Slack:** Timing is met ‚úÖ  
- **Negative Slack:** Timing violation ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## 3. Expected Time
Defines target arrival times for signals at endpoints.

- **Setup (Max Delay):** Latest data arrival before next clock edge  
- **Hold (Min Delay):** Minimum time data must remain stable after clock edge

## 4. Types of Timing Analysis

### 4.1 Setup and Hold Path Categories

| Type     | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| reg2reg   | Between two flip-flops (launch ‚Üí capture) |
| in2reg    | Input port ‚Üí Flip-flop D pin              |
| reg2out   | Flip-flop output ‚Üí Output port            |
| in2out    | Input port ‚Üí Output port                  |

### 4.2 Other Timing Analyses
- **Clock Gating:** Verifies no glitches occur when enabling/disabling clocks.  
- **Recovery/Removal:** For asynchronous reset/preset signals.  
  - *Recovery Time:* Reset inactive before clock edge  
  - *Removal Time:* Reset active after clock edge  
- **Latch Timing (Time Borrowing):** Latches can ‚Äúborrow‚Äù time when transparent.

---

## 5. Slew / Transition Analysis
**Slew** measures how quickly a signal transitions from one logic level to another.

- **Data Slew:** Transition rate of data signals  
- **Clock Slew:** Transition rate of clock signals  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Excessive Slew ‚Üí** slower logic, higher power, and degraded timing.

---

## 6. Load Analysis
Verifies whether drivers meet electrical limits.

- **Fanout:** Number of loads driven  
- **Capacitance:** Total load on a signal line  
- **Goal:** Ensure load is within library-specified limits for accurate delay estimation.

---

## 7. Clock Analysis

### 7.1 Clock Skew
**Skew = Capture Clock Latency ‚Äì Launch Clock Latency
Clock skew affects setup and hold margins.

### 7.2 Pulse Width
- Duration of clock‚Äôs **HIGH** or **LOW** phase.  
- Must meet **minimum pulse width** requirements for correct sequential logic operation.

---

## 8. Timing Graph Model
STA tools represent the circuit as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** ‚Äî also called a **Timing Graph**.

- **Nodes:** Pins or nets  
- **Edges:** Timing arcs with delays  

üßÆ **Calculation Flow**
- **AAT** (Actual Arrival Time): Computed forward from sources  
- **RAT** (Required Arrival Time): Computed backward from endpoints  
- **Slack:** `Slack = RAT ‚Äì AAT`  

AAT should always be **‚â§ RAT** for successful timing closure.

## 9. Analysis Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **PBA (Path-Based Analysis)** | Accurate, follows exact physical path; slower |
| **GBA (Graph-Based Analysis)** | Approximate, pessimistic but faster |

---

## 10. Setup and Hold Verification

### 10.1 Setup Check
Ensures data arrives **before** the capture clock edge.  
**Combinational Delay < Clock Period ‚Äì Setup Time

### 10.2 Hold Check
Ensures data remains stable **after** the clock edge.  
Combinational Delay > Hold Time


---

## 11. Latches and Flip-Flops

| Element | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| **Positive Latch** | Passes input to output when clock is HIGH |
| **Negative Latch** | Passes input to output when clock is LOW |
| **Flip-Flop** | Combines master (negative latch) and slave (positive latch) stages |

üß© **Timing Parameters**
- **Setup Time:** Data must be stable before clock edge  
- **Hold Time:** Data must remain stable after clock edge  
- **CLK‚ÜíQ Delay:** Propagation time from clock edge to Q output  

---

## 12. Jitter and Uncertainty
- **Jitter:** Random variation in clock edge timing (visualized in eye diagrams).  
- **Noise Margin:** Tolerance to noise/distortion.  
- **Uncertainty:** Extra timing margin added to account for jitter and variations.

---

## 13. On-Chip Variation (OCV)
Differences in **voltage** and **ground potential** across a chip cause delay variation.

- **Voltage Droop:** Temporary voltage reduction during switching.  
- **Ground Bounce:** Ground potential fluctuation due to return currents.

üßÆ **OCV Derates**
- **Max Derate:** Adds delay (used for setup checks)  
- **Min Derate:** Reduces delay (used for hold checks)

---

## 14. Process Variations
Manufacturing variations affect transistor characteristics and path delays.

### 14.1 Sources of Variation
- **Etching Process:** Alters resistance and capacitance  
- **Oxide Thickness:** Changes threshold voltage ‚Üí delay variation  

---

## 15. Clock Effects
- **Clock Pull-In:** Clock arrives earlier ‚Üí reduced delay  
- **Clock Push-Out:** Clock arrives later ‚Üí increased delay  

### 15.1 Pessimism and Removal
STA assumes **worst-case** conditions (max skew, jitter, OCV).  
**Pessimism Removal** reduces over-conservative margins to better match real silicon performance.

---

## üßæ Summary
Static Timing Analysis ensures that:
- All timing paths meet setup and hold constraints.  
- No path violates clock, load, or slew specifications.  
- Circuit functions correctly at the intended clock frequency across all PVT corners.
